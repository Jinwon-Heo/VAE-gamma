# VAE-gamma
Gamma-mixture variational autoencoder for clustering right-skewed gene expression data
# Introduction
Our proposed model, VAE-gamma, is clustering model for right-skewed data such as gene expression data. Because the model apply the variational autoencoder, we can reduce the dimension of data into the latent variable $z$. Thus, the proposed model can show good performance in high-dimensional having small sample size data. The informative
